- Click Dashboard â†’ Create an App.
- Enter an App Name, Description, and a Redirect URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080).
- Select the Web API option, agree to the Developer Terms of Service, and click Create.

*Obtain API Credentials:* 
- In your app's dashboard, go to Settings.
- Copy your Client ID and Client Secret.

**ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Create a Genius Developer Account**

*Sign Up or Log In:*

**ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Environment Setup**

To securely store API credentials, create a .env file in your project directory and add the following lines:

SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_genius_access_token

*Install Required R Packages:*
Before making API requests, install the necessary R packages:

install.packages(c("httr", "jsonlite", "dplyr", "dotenv"))
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
library(dotenv)

*Load API Credentials in R*
Your .Rmd file will use the .env file to load credentials securely
_run these in an R chunk_
load_dot_env()
spotify_client_id <- Sys.getenv("SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID")
spotify_client_secret <- Sys.getenv("SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET")
genius_access_token <- Sys.getenv("GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN")
